# user_facade
# forecast_service
# spot_service
# user_service

# now, I must do aws stuff

# first, it said region was missing, defining AWS_REGION env var helped with that
# `export AWS_REGION='us-east-1'`
# AMENDED to say its best to configure and point to us-east-1 as region

# then, it said:
# `    AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::261071831482:assumed-role/CdkAppStack-webserverroleDB0308B6-0I5YHaVPGY8M/i-0c95159834468e476 is not authorized to perform: s3:PutObject on resource: "arn:aws:s3:::ww-s3-adapter-test/TPI_420_69/geometry.json" because no identity-based policy allows the s3:PutObject action`
# so i will adjust the role definition in CDK
#
# solved by changing ec2 user perms to s3fullaccess

# now... time to get interesting,
# db tests are failing
#
# this is multi step
# 0. pull secret from secret manager
# aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:261071831482:secret:PictureDatabaseSecretEC4117-3I44o6dfTbXR-WcTdv7
# 1. use secret to connect to db (from ec2) and create tables on cloud db
# 2. adjust tests st they call cloud db
# 3. get tests to use secret manager

# is mad that env var is not set
# which reminds me that i need to do some thign in app config to make it work
# then
#   db will work
# then its time to do integ tests, which will probably work (after giving permissions for ec2 to call cognito)
#   I think I'm skupping this because I am fairly confident these will work if I get all the pointers right
# then set up routing (using app_config and updating cdk as we go)
#   gonna do this with nginx
#     calling <public ip>:443/spots -> localhost:8080/spot
#     calling <public ip>:443/favorites -> localhost:8080/favorite
#     calling <public ip>:443/forecasts -> localhost:8081/forecasts
#     calling <public ip>:443/users -> localhost:8082/user
#   step 1 - install nginx, record command command to do so here - done
#   step 2 - modify nginx.conf file such that it redirects to the correct service
#            this will be a pain to redo, but might as well do it quickly once
#            gonna run all these services and record their pids here: 78656 - 78849 - 78911

#  * now, set up app user:
# 1. Create the user
# sudo adduser appuser --gecos "App User"

# 2. Disable login by setting the shell to /sbin/nologin
# sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin appuser

# 3. (Optional) Lock the userâ€™s password
# sudo passwd -l appuser

# now, how to run auotmatically/in background with pm2
# https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/
# * i can probably use 'Ecosystem File' to run the three services and weather updater
# * how to run as specific user? - `sudo -u appuser pm2 start app.js` (from AI)
#
# now, I will pull and build code with appuser
# naw, i will use the already pulled and built code and change ownership with:
# sudo chown -R appuser:appuser /path/to/your/app
# sudo chmod -R 750 /path/to/your/app

# lets go quick,
# push off specific user stuff
# just do pm2 stuff
# `npm install pm2@latest -g`
