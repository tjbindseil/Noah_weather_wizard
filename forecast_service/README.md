# Forecast Service
You guessed it, this service gets forecast data.

What is interesting (and currently undecided), is the details of this.

What is the API?

What is the caching mechanism? (I guess its been deciced that a cache mechanism is needed)

What is the mechanism that will wait 5 seconds when a call fails in order to let NOAA timeout happen?
